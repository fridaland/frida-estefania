            Lastly, I'm working on launching a nonprofit called "Huellitas".
            Huellitas will have a focus on working hard to protect animals from abuse, neglect, and cruelty. 
            Once we are fully established, we will be a no-kill, all-hugs rescue/sanctuary for animals with no place else to go. 
            At Huellitas, we will rehabilitate, train and give animals another chance at the life they truly deserve. 
            Head over to "Huellitas" to learn more.
